They will then be directed to the barber profile page.

From there, users will be able to customize their barber profile by adding haircut styles and pricing...

...along with gallery photos of their personal work to establish credibility amongst other users.

Also from the barber profile page, users may "Book an Appointment" with the selected barber. Choosing to do so redirects the user to the barber's Square Appointments page, via which the user may schedule an appointment with their personal details.
